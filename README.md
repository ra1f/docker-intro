# Docker Intro

### Virtualization on Mac or Windows

If you do not run on Linux you need a Vagrant Box (inside of VirtualBox), Boot2Docker or another virtualization 
product which provides a Linux Kernel. Docker is based upon LXC [Linux Containers] and therefore Linux is mandatory.

Please install Vagrant and Virtual Box on your Mac or Windows system. Then apply the Vagrantfile accordingly.

> `vagrant up`
> `vagrant ssh`
> `vagrant@docker-intro:~$ cd /vagrant`
